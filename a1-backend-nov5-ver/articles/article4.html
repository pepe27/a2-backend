        <h2>Farro and Escarole Soup</h2>
        <p>Author: Bon Appetit</p>
        <p>This delicate, brothy grain soup manages to be comforting and fortifying—but without requiring a nap afterward. If you have really good homemade stock on hand, you can use it instead of the water called for here; the soup will only benefit from the addition. But even if you don’t, the flavors will get richer and more concentrated the longer it sits, which means it’s a great make-ahead recipe for a weekday lunch or dinner. This dish is part of the Bon Appétit Guide to Actually Enjoying Your Lunch at Work. Find more recipes, tips, and tricks here.

            Ingredients
            4 servings
            4
            
            garlic cloves, thinly sliced
            3
            
            Tbsp. capers
            ¼
            
            cup extra-virgin olive oil
            1
            
            medium onion, finely chopped
            1
            
            cup unhulled farro or spelt
            ½
            
            tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
            6
            
            celery stalks, thinly sliced on a diagonal
            4
            
            cups torn escarole or kale
            1
            
            oz. finely grated Parmesan (about ¼ cup)
            Kosher salt
            Preparation
            Step 1
            Cook garlic, capers, and oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until garlic is golden, 4–6 minutes. Add onion, farro, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
            
            Step 2
            Add 6 cups cold water to pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until farro is tender, 20–25 minutes. Add celery and cook, uncovered, until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Stir escarole and Parmesan into soup and continue to cook until escarole is wilted, another 4 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt.
            
            Step 3
            Do Ahead: Soup can be made 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.
