        <h2>Salt-and-Sugar Pork Rib Chops</h2>
        <p>Author: Carla Lalli Music</p>
        <p>This quick weeknight dinner for two from Carla Lalli Music’s That Sounds So Good feels like a fancy plate you’d order at the bar of a perfect neighborhood restaurant. The salt-and-sugar combo helps the pork chop quickly achieve a golden brown crust, and doing everything in the same skillet imparts a ton of flavor to the onion and radicchio as well. Grab Carla’s new book, That Sounds So Good, out now.

        Ingredients
        2 servings
        2

        tsp. sugar
        2

        tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
        1

        lb. 1"-thick bone-in pork rib chops
        4

        Tbsp. grapeseed or vegetable oil, divided
        1

        small onion, thinly sliced crosswise, separated into rings
        1

        head of Treviso radicchio or other radicchio (12–14 oz.), coarsely chopped
        1

        lemon, halved
        Honey (for drizzling)
        Flaky sea salt
        Dijon mustard (for serving)
        Preparation
        Step 1
        Combine sugar and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl. Lightly pound pork chops with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or the heel of your hand to ½" thick. Pat chops dry; season all over with salt mixture.

        Step 2
        Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high 2 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp. oil, followed by pork chops. Cook chops, pressing down to ensure good contact with pan and turning every minute, until very well browned and charred in spots and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135°, 5–7 minutes. (Chops will still be a little pink inside; if you prefer yours well-done, cook another minute or two.) Transfer chops to a large plate and let rest 10 minutes.

        Step 3
        While the chops are resting, carefully pour off fat from skillet and wipe out any burnt bits. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Add onion and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until floppy and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Working in batches, add radicchio, tossing and letting it wilt slightly before adding more; season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until radicchio is wilted and tender with just a little bite in the thickest ribs, about 3 minutes. Squeeze in juice from a lemon half; toss to combine. Transfer radicchio mixture to a platter and drizzle a little honey over.

        Step 4
        To serve, carve meat away from pork chop bones and slice against the grain; arrange on platter alongside radicchio. Drizzle any accumulated juices over meat and season with sea salt. Serve with Dijon for dragging pork through and remaining lemon half for squeezing over.
